title: How to Embedded Share Card
---

This is an example of an embedded card:

<iframe
src="https://precal.xyehr.cn/embed/1763113121914rz8b03g"
width="500"
height="300"
frameborder="0"
scrolling="no"
></iframe>

To complete this, add this HTML code to your site:

```html

<iframe
    src="https://calendar.xyehr.cn/embed/shareId"
    width="500"
    height="300"
    frameborder="0"
    scrolling="no"
></iframe>

```

Replace `shareId` with the shareId of your share link, usually the characters after `share/` in the link.

You can also adjust the width and height to suit your layout design.
