Dear friends, users and supporters,

Today, we celebrate Tech-Artâ€™s 1st anniversary with excitement and gratitude! This year, we have experienced countless challenges and growth, gained valuable experience, and felt the support and encouragement from you. It is because of you that we can come to this day.

Looking back on this year, we have launched many projects and poured our efforts and creativity into them. However, we have also made some difficult decisions and cancelled some products. These decisions are not made lightly, but to enable us to pursue excellence more focused and efficiently. Although it is sad to say goodbye to some projects, we believe that this opens the door to new possibilities.

Now, we are going all out to create an exciting new project - Open Workspace! This project is our exploration of the future of office and collaboration, aiming to provide users with a flexible, open and inspiring digital work environment. We hope that Open Workspace is not only a tool, but also a platform to inspire creativity, connect people and dreams. At present, the project is under intensive development, and we can't wait to share more details with you in the future!

The first anniversary is a starting point and an opportunity for us to stop and look back to the past and look forward to the future. We know that there is still a long way to go, but with your support, we are confident that we will meet more challenges and create more value.

Thank you to everyone who has accompanied us through this year. Let us look forward to the excitement of Open Workspace and a brighter future for Tech-Art!

Tech-Art Team
